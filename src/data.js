    title: "Làm thế nào ứng phó với chủ nghĩa hư vô",
    body: "<p>Như chúng ta đã thấy trong Chương 2, Kant giao lại một vấn đề cho những hậu duệ duy tâm, lãng mạn, và thậm chí Mác-xít trong truyền thống Lục địa, một vấn đề mà ông vật vã tìm cách giải quyết trong Phê phán năng lực phán đoánvà đó là cốt lõi trong những phê phán của Jacobi đối với Kant và Fichte. Vấn đề đó giờ đây có thể được trình bày như sau: Sự phê phán của triết học Kant dành cho siêu hình học, nếu hợp lý, đạt được một thành quả đáng chú ý khi vừa cho thấy sự vô nghĩa về nhận thức của những tuyên bố truyền thống về siêu hình học tư biện, giáo điều, vừa thiết lập nhu cầu đạo đức điều hành đối với tính thứ nhất của lý tính thực hành (tức là, khái niệm tự do). Điều đó làm nảy sinh câu hỏi: tự do sẽ được trình bày bằng dẫn chứng hay có hiệu lực trong thế giới tự nhiên như thế nào, nếu thế giới tự nhiên bị chi phối bởi quan hệ nhân quả và bị tất định một cách máy móc bởi những qui luật của tự nhiên? Tính nhân quả của thế giới tự nhiên có thể hòa giải với điều mà Kant gọi là “tính nhân quả của tự do” như thế nào? Để ám chỉ Emerson bóng gió dùng ngôn ngữ của cuốn Phê phán Thứ ba của Kant, thiên tài sẽ chuyển hóa thành sức mạnh thực hành như thế nào? Chẳng phải Kant đặt con người vào cái mà Hegel và Marx trẻ có lẽ đã gọi là vị trí lưỡng cư, vừa tự do tuân thủ luật đạo đức vừa bị tất định bởi một thế giới tự nhiên khách quan vốn đã bị tước hết mọi giá trị và chống lại con người với tư cách một thế giới tha hóa đó sao? Chẳng phải tự do cá nhân bị qui giản thành một thứ trừu tượng trước một thế giới tầm thường của các vật thể vốn sẵn có đó cho con người – với giá đắt –  với tư cách hàng hóa hay sao?<br/><br/>Đó là vấn đề mà Nietzsche đã tìm ra nguyên do bằng khái niệm chủ nghĩa hư vô – một khái niệm cực kỳ then chốt đối với rất nhiều nhà tư tưởng Lục địa của thế kỷ 20: Heidegger, Walter Benjamin, Theodor Adorno, Carl Schmitt, Hannah Arendt, Jacques Lacan, Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, và Julia Kristeva. Đó là, việc thừa nhận tự do của chủ thể đi đôi với sự sụp đổ của sự xác tín đạo đức trong thế giới này. Trong Chương 2, chúng ta sẽ truy nguyên sự xuất hiện của khái niệm này từ sự phê phán Kant và Fichte của Jacobi cho đến Stirner, Dostoevsky, và Sartre. Bây giờ tôi muốn trở lại với chủ đề chủ nghĩa hư vô để tìm hiểu sâu hơn.<br/><br/>CHỦ NGHĨA HƯ VÔ NGA<br/><br/>Sự nhận thức về chủ nghĩa hư vô của Nietzsche phải được đặt trong bối cảnh nước Nga đã được nhắc đến trong Chương 2 liên quan đến Dostoevsky – điều mà ông gọi là “chủ nghĩa hư vô theo kiểu Petersburg”. Nietzsche chọn khái niệm chủ nghĩa hư vô từ tiểu thuyết gia Nga Ivan Turgenev, đọc qua bản dịch tiếng Pháp của Prosper Mérimée. Ngẫu nhiên mà tiểu thuyết Carmen (1845) của Mérimée cũng cung cấp cơ sở cho lời thoại trong nhạc kịch cùng tên (1875) của Bizet mà Nietzsche rất thích – một chọn lựa đầy tranh cãi đối với tôi, nhưng đó là một chuyện khác. Chính qua tay của Nietzsche mà chủ nghĩa hư vô có được diễn ngôn triết lý trọn vẹn và sự thể hiện đầy đủ nhất của nó.<br/><br/>Cái phân biệt bối cảnh Nga với bối cảnh Đức là, trong phiên bản Đức, chủ nghĩa hư vô chủ yếu là vấn đề siêu hình học hay nhận thức luận, trong khi đó ở Nga, nó có một chiều kích xã hội-chính trị rõ ràng hơn. Có thể nói câu chuyện bắt đầu với nỗ lực của Nikolai Chernyshevski muốn “hư vô hóa” những giá trị thẩm mỹ truyền thống bằng cách biện luận rằng nghệ thuật không phải là sự biểu lộ một quan niệm tuyệt đối nào đó về cái đẹp, mà đúng hơn là trình bày những mối quan tâm của một tầng lớp nhất định vào một thời điểm nhất định trong lịch sử. Vì thế, trong bối cảnh Nga, vấn nạn chủ nghĩa hư vô gắn chặt với vấn đề chính trị xã hội cấp tiến, được thể hiện đầy đủ trong tiểu thuyết gây ảnh hưởng mạnh mẽ của Chernyshevski, Phải làm gì? (1863). Toàn bộ câu chuyện về vấn đề chính trị của chủ nghĩa hư vô Nga sẽ phải bao gồm sự phê phán có tính chất vô chính phủ của Bakunin đối với nhà nước, và có lẽ kết thúc trong Chủ nghĩa Bôn-sê-vích Promethean và Cách mạng tháng Mười năm 1917. Không phải ngẫu nhiên mà cuốn sách viết năm 1902 trong đó Lê-nin trình bày viễn kiến chính trị của ông về đảng và “chuyên chính vô sản” cũng sẽ được lấy tựa đề Phải làm gì?<br/><br/>Theo nghĩa đó, chủ nghĩa hư vô Nga là sự biểu lộ một thế giới quan hoài nghi triệt để, phản-thẩm mỹ, thực dụng, và khoa học. Một quan điểm như thế chịu sự phê phán kiểu cách nhưng tự do đến độ hủy hoại trong tiểu thuyết Cha và con  (1862) của Turgenev thông qua số phận của nhân vật hư vô chủ nghĩa Bazarov. Xung đột kịch tính nhất ở đây là giữa hai thế giới quan đối lập: chủ nghĩa lãng mạn, chủ nghĩa tự do, chủ nghĩa cải lương, và sự ngưỡng mộ châu Âu của những người cha (Nikolai và Pavel) và thực chứng luận, chủ nghĩa công lợi, chủ nghĩa cấp tiến, và chủ nghĩa dân tộc Nga của những đứa con (Arkady và Bazarov). Ở đây chúng ta có sự biểu lộ theo cách Nga sự xung đột của Mill giữa chủ nghĩa lãng mạn và chủ nghĩa công lợi, Bentham và Coleridge. Trong một cảnh quan trọng của cuốn tiểu thuyết, giữa những lời ám chỉ mơ hồ về chủ nghĩa hư vô như một thế lực khởi nghĩa bạo động, Bazarov cười khinh bỉ,</p>",

    body: "<p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p><h2>Why do we use it?</h2><p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p><h2>Where does it come from?</h2><p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p><p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p><h2>Where can I get some?</h2><p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>NewStory.js:32 <p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.

Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p><ul><li>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</li><li>Quisque vel est id dolor elementum mollis porta eu leo.</li><li>Nunc sed sapien hendrerit, sagittis libero eget, vehicula nibh.</li><li>Suspendisse sodales tellus vel lectus accumsan, a lobortis libero convallis.</li><li>Donec sed libero dictum, blandit nisi vitae, aliquet justo.</li><li>In elementum metus at mollis euismod.</li><li>Fusce eleifend risus sed ultricies sodales.</li><li>Fusce non ligula non neque lobortis molestie.</li><li>Nunc lobortis ante eget orci sodales, in hendrerit eros porttitor.</li><li>Aenean convallis magna quis gravida hendrerit.</li><li>Phasellus eu dui laoreet enim fringilla pulvinar iaculis a ipsum.</li><li>Cras imperdiet sapien pharetra commodo aliquet.</li><li>Maecenas accumsan velit a diam efficitur, a faucibus tortor egestas.</li><li>Ut at neque sodales, molestie lorem a, varius dolor.</li><li>Integer id neque eget diam facilisis pulvinar.</li><li>Integer ac purus vitae erat tempus mollis.</li></ul>",

Who you are and where you from, your power can’t break a friendship. I can say, even Hitlar didn’t have this power to break it. It is the toughest relationship in this galaxy.</p><p>I’ve got some friends in my life. They’re the most valuable person to me. There is no other reasons for it, only friendship. Most of the friends I’ve got in my life are very simple in their nature. They’re very friendly. They can sacrifice anything for me. They give me inspirations when I need. In fact I get everything. My life couldn’t be perfect if I didn’t meet some people. I don’t want to mention their name here because I can’t describe them with my bad English. After all, I have to say that I’ve got a best friend circle in the world. We’ve got us, we’ve got each other. Thanks duds for being with me….</p>",
